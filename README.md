# What is this?
OnceInABlueMood (or BlueMood for short) is a simple habit/mood-logging app for Android devices.
Users can add entries with a mood (ranging from very bad to very good - the interpretation is the user's)
Entries can have an optional text description, a date, a time, and even a location.

# Things that would be neat to add:
* Simple statistics
* Reverse geocoding (coordinates to an address)
* A customizable tag system to represent activities & factors influencing a mood entry
* A better UI/UX
